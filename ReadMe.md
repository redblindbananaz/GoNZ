## Project Overview

The contents of this repository are specifically created and tailored to meet the requirements of the educational assessment. The project included here showcases my ability to:

- **LO 1:** Integrate security and privacy principles throughout Software Development Life Circle (SDLC) to ensure web application security and system level integrity through application of current best IT industry practices
- **LO 2:** Investigate, design and implement authentication, authorisation and validation to protect data, ensure confidentiality, set user permissions and preserve data integrity.

## Features

- super admin user, users, user groups, and ‘signup’ and ‘login’ views
- URLs for navigation
- Different users and group permissions
- User experience design

## Requirements

To install all the necessary packages and versions specified in the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all requiered dependencies and versions for this project.

## Installation

### Mac:

1. **Install Python:** If Python is not already installed on your Mac, you can download and install it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Open Terminal:** Launch the Terminal application on your Mac. You can find it in the "Utilities" folder within the "Applications" folder.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:** In the Terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project. To create a virtual environment, use the following command:

```
python3 -m venv myenv
```

Replace `myenv` with the desired name of your virtual environment.

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Replace `myenv` with the name of your virtual environment.

5. **Install Django:** With the virtual environment activated, use pip to install Django:

```
pip install django
```

### Windows:

1. **Install Python:** If Python is not already installed on your Windows machine, you can download and install it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Open Command Prompt:** Press the Windows key on your keyboard, then type "Command Prompt" and press Enter. Alternatively, you can open the "Start" menu, go to the "Windows System" folder, and click on "Command Prompt."

3. **Create a Virtual Environment:** In the Command Prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to create your Django project. To create a virtual environment, use the following command:

```
python -m venv myenv
```

Replace `myenv` with the desired name of your virtual environment.

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** Activate the virtual environment using the following command:

```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Replace `myenv` with the name of your virtual environment.

5. **Install Django:** With the virtual environment activated, use pip to install Django:

```
pip install django
```

Remember to customize the virtual environment name (`myenv`) as desired.
These instructions will help you set up a virtual environment and install Django on both Mac and Windows.
